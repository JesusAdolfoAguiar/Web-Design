		    <details open><summary>My Childhood</summary>
    <p>I grew up in Guanare, Venezuela, in a little farm of my grandparents at the outskirts of town. It was the purest contact with nature. Wild animals hanged arround, like ducks, owls and other birds, turtles, snakes, deers and many other. The farm even had a big pound in which me and my family used to have fun. At age 8, I moved out to an apartment in Guanare's downtown.</p></details>
